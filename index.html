I currently a full-time student at the Southern New Hampshire University finishing a Bachelors of Sciences in Information Technology with a Specialty in Cyber Security. I was also enrolled in a full-time fullstack development bootcamp program through the University of Oregon but had to withdraw from it. I am excited to learn more about web development and data science in this class.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently residing in Oregon, but could be convinced to relocate if remote work is not possible. I am interested in cyber security and web development. While I am just learning to work with software development and coding, I have experience in the hardware side of IT from full desktop/sever builds, network equipment and cabling installations, software installations and troubleshooting, to equipment maintenance for print-server farms, ups reliability testing, and physical security control installations. I am looking forward to working with you.</p>
