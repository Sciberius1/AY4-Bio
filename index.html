        <div class="text-box" id="about"><p>Hello,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Andrew Yon IV. I am a student at the Southern New Hampshire University studying Information Technology with a Specialty in Cyber Security. I am currently residing in Oregon, but could be convinced to relocate if remote work is not possible. I am interested in cyber security and web development. I am attending a full stack development bootcamp while maintaining my academic average at SNHU, where I am pursuing a Bachelor's in Cyber Security.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am excited to learn more about web development and data science in this class. I have experience in the hardware side of IT from full system builds, network equipment and cabling installations, and OS installations. I am just learning to work with software development and coding. I am looking forward to working with you.</p>
